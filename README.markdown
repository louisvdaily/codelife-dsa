# Welcome to the CodeLife Data Structures and Algorithms Project!

Here you will find my personal, detailed explanations of data structures and algorithms (DSA).
I'm using this as an opportunity to brush up on my theoretical knowledge of these abstract concepts.
The goal of this project is to **explain how data structures and algorithms work**.
I will not be writing code in this repo. I will be copying the contents of this repo and implementing the concepts
in different languages.

Any who, I hope this helps someone along the way in their studies of DSA. Cheers!
